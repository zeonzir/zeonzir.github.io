Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), aka. dump and regress, are a formidable form of end to end gradient machines that are taking over rapidly in the various domains. 
Indeed, their boom has coincided with that of high end GPUs with rapid processing power.
 
However, in their vanilla form, they stand unable to handle sequence data. These data form the next major barrier in various problem spaces and need to be handled effectively for CNNs to take the next great leap.



Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
